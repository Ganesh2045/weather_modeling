# 🌦 Weather Modeling Using Quadratic Equation  

This project demonstrates **weather prediction** using a simple **quadratic equation** and shows how the same system can be developed under different **software engineering models**:  

- 🏗 **Waterfall Model**  
- 🔄 **Iterative Model**  
- ⚡ **Agile Model (Scrum)**  

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict **temperature** throughout the day using:

- Simulate the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** in 3 approaches  
- Compare predictions using **actual vs hypothetical data**  

---

## 📌 Features
- Hourly temperature forecast  
- Daily summary (avg. temp, rainfall, humidity)  
- Graphical visualization (Matplotlib)  
- Weather alerts for extreme conditions  
- Demonstrates **Waterfall, Iterative, Agile** workflows  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib  

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
